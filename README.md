# Restaurant

In this project we have created a iOS app for a restaurant, that allows the customer to view a list of offerings, add items to a order, and submit the order to the restaurant. Using a server that you'll run on your own computer, you'll have an opportunity to modify the options, descriptions, and images that are returned from the API.

## Run the server
The server folder included with this project contains the binary file for the server. Double-click the OpenRestaurant.app file.

To start and stop the server, click the button at the bottom right.

Server Address: http://localhost:8090

Now the server is ready for client connections!

## Run the iOS app

From the command line, run:

pod install

Use the .xcworkspace file generated by CocoaPods to work on your project, and run the project
